spaceview
=========

A viewer for spacecraft path and pictures taken. The path data is extracted
from [NASA HORIZON](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons). Each point on the
map indicates the availability of image data. This visualization builds upon
[spaceappshacks](https://github.com/gregstachowski/spaceappsdatahacks) and
[py-NASA-horizions](https://github.com/tpltnt/py-NASA-horizons).
